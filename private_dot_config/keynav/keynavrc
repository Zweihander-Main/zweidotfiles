# This is a keynavrc file. Yours should live in 
# $HOME/.config/keynav/keynavrc
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
# Format is:
#   keysequence cmd1,cmd2,cmd3...
#
# Other special values are:
#   'clear' on a line by itself (no quotes) will erase all keybindings
#   (including the defaults)
#   'daemonize' on a line by itself (no quotes) will make keynav background
#   after parsing the configfile and having no critical errors.
# 
# The 'start' command alone is handled specially, in that any key sequence
# mapped to 'start' will be grabbed when keynav starts up so you can invoke it
# to activate keynav. The remaining keys are only recognized while keynav is
# active
